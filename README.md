# CodeClause_Sentiment-Analysis

What It Does:
Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service or idea.

1️⃣ Data Collection
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
4️⃣ Dataset Balancing & Scaling
5️⃣ Machine Learning Models Training & Evaluation

Prerequisites:
I would highly recommend that before the hack night, you should have some kind of toolchain and development environment already installed and ready. If you have no idea where to start with this, try a combination like:

1️⃣ Python
2️⃣ nltk
3️⃣ Pandas
4️⃣ NumPy
5️⃣ Matplotlib
6️⃣ An environment to work in - something like Jupyter or colab

For Linux people, your package manager should be able to handle all of this. If it somehow can't, see if you can at least install Python and pip and then use pip to install the above packages.
